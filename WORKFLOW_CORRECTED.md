📋 CORRECTED WORKFLOW GUIDE
===============================

🎯 ISSUE FIXED: Team members can now use the CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE independently!

## ✅ What Was Wrong Before
- Distribution package tried to copy files from parent directory
- When team members got only the package folder, the parent directory didn't exist
- Result: "app.py not found in parent directory" error

## ✅ What's Fixed Now
- CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE is completely self-contained
- Contains all Python files needed to run the tool
- No dependency on parent directories
- Team members can copy and use the folder anywhere

## 🚀 Your New Workflow

### For Development (You):
1. **Edit files**: Work in main directory (`app.py`, `ui_sections.py`, etc.)
2. **Test changes**: Run `DEV_HELPER.bat` → Option 1
3. **Update distribution**: Run `DEV_HELPER.bat` → Option 2 (syncs files)
4. **Share**: Give team the entire `CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE` folder

### For Team Members:
1. **Get the folder**: Copy entire `CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE` to their computer
2. **Setup**: Double-click `SETUP.bat` (one time)
3. **Use tool**: Double-click `START_MAPPING_TOOL.bat`
4. **Stop tool**: Double-click `STOP_APP.bat`

## 🎯 Key Benefits

✅ **Single source editing**: You edit files once in main directory
✅ **Easy sync**: DEV_HELPER.bat copies files to distribution package  
✅ **Self-contained sharing**: Team gets everything in one folder
✅ **No dependency issues**: Works anywhere, no parent directory needed
✅ **Clean separation**: Development vs distribution clearly separated

## 💡 Important Notes

- Edit files ONLY in main directory
- Use DEV_HELPER.bat Option 2 after making changes
- Share the ENTIRE CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE folder
- Team members can copy this folder anywhere and it will work
- No more "file not found" errors!

🎉 The sharing issue is now completely resolved!
