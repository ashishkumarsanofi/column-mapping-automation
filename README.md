- **CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE**: Complete self-contained package with all files

## For Developers üõ†Ô∏è

2. **Test changes**: Run `DEV_HELPER.bat` ‚Üí Option 1 (or `streamlit run app.py`)
3. **Update distribution**: Run `DEV_HELPER.bat` ‚Üí Option 2 (copies files to package)
4. **Share with team**: Give them the entire `CLEAN_DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE` folder
