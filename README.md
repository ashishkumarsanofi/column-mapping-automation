# üìä Advanced Column Mapping & Transformation Tool

Welcome to the **Advanced Column Mapping & Transformation Tool**! This tool is designed to help you map, transform, and consolidate data from multiple input files into a single output file with ease. Built with Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for managing column mappings, applying filters, and handling static values.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-File Support**: Upload multiple input files (Excel or CSV) and map them to a single output template.
- **Sheet Selection**: Choose specific sheets from Excel files for processing.
- **Column Mapping**: Map input columns to output columns with optional static values.
- **Filters**: Apply filters to input data for precise transformations.
- **Date Formatting**: Automatically format date columns to `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- **Error Handling**: Highlights mapping errors and provides actionable feedback.
- **Download Options**: Export the final output as Excel or TXT (pipe-concatenated) files.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload one or more input files (Excel or CSV).
   - Upload an output template file to define the desired column structure.

2. **Select Sheets**:
   - For Excel files, select the sheets you want to process.

3. **Map Columns**:
   - Use the intuitive interface to map input columns to output columns.
   - Add static values or apply filters as needed.

4. **Generate Output**:
   - Click the "Generate Final Output" button to process the files.
   - Download the final output as Excel or TXT.

5. **Tips**:
   - üí° Convert Excel files to CSV format for faster processing before uploading.

## üìú Version Control

### Version 1.1
- Initial release with support for multi-file uploads, column mapping, and output generation.

### Version 1.4
- Added support for handling empty first rows in input files.
- Improved error handling for missing columns in mapping files.
- Changed TXT file encoding from UTF-8 to UTF-16.
- Added a suggestion to convert Excel files to CSV for faster processing.

### Version 1.5
- Added Cell Reference

### Version 1.5.1
- Fixed duplicate column names in same row

### Version 1.6
- Whitespace is now stripped from all column names before deduplication. This ensures that columns like 'fruit ' and 'fruit' are treated as the same column, and mapping to duplicate columns (e.g., 'fruit', 'fruit_1') works robustly even if there are extra spaces in the Excel file. This fixes mapping and filter issues for columns with trailing or leading spaces.

### Version 1.7
- **Fixed Date Formatting Bug**: Resolved issue where date formatting checkbox was not working properly. Previously, columns with "date" in their names were automatically formatted to `yyyy-mm-dd` regardless of user selection.
- **Improved User Control**: Date formatting now properly respects user checkbox selections - dates are only formatted when explicitly checked by the user.
- **Multi-file Date Handling**: Fixed date format flag logic to properly consolidate date formatting preferences across multiple input files.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Removed automatic date formatting override that was ignoring user preferences, giving users full control over date column formatting.

## üö¶ Limits & Recommendations

- **Number of Input Files:**
  - There is no hard-coded limit on the number of input files you can upload. However, uploading a very large number of files (e.g., dozens or more) may slow down the app or hit browser/memory limits, depending on your system resources.

- **Excel Sheets per File:**
  - You can select and process any number of sheets from each Excel file. There is no explicit limit, but performance may degrade with very large or complex workbooks.

- **File Size Limit:**
  - Streamlit's default file uploader supports files up to 200MB. For best performance, keep individual files under 50MB. Large files may cause slow uploads, memory errors, or browser crashes.
  - You can increase the file size limit by setting `server.maxUploadSize` in your `.streamlit/config.toml` (see Streamlit documentation).

- **Recommended Data Size:**
  - For smooth operation, keep total data (all files combined) under 100,000 rows. Larger datasets may work but could be slow or unstable, depending on your hardware.

- **Other Notes:**
  - Only Excel (`.xlsx`) and CSV files are supported as input.
  - Avoid using files with extremely wide tables (hundreds of columns), as UI and memory issues may occur.
  - If you encounter performance issues, try splitting your data into smaller files or converting Excel to CSV for faster processing.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional file formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
- Enable advanced filtering options with custom logic.
- Provide real-time previews of transformations.
