# üìä Advanced Column Mapping & Transformation Tool

Welcome to the **Advanced Column Mapping & Transformation Tool**! This tool is designed to help you map, transform, and consolidate data from multiple input files into a single output file with ease. Built with Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for managing column mappings, applying filters, and handling static values.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-File Support**: Upload multiple input files (Excel or CSV) and map them to a single output template.
- **Sheet Selection**: Choose specific sheets from Excel files for processing.
- **Column Mapping**: Map input columns to output columns with optional static values.
- **Filters**: Apply filters to input data for precise transformations.
- **Date Formatting**: Automatically format date columns to `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- **Error Handling**: Highlights mapping errors and provides actionable feedback.
- **Download Options**: Export the final output as Excel or TXT (pipe-concatenated) files.

   - For Excel files, select the sheets you want to process.

3. **Map Columns**:
   - Use the intuitive interface to map input columns to output columns.
   - Add static values or apply filters as needed.

4. **Generate Output**:

## üìú Version Control

### Version 1.1
- Initial release with support for multi-file uploads, column mapping, and output generation.

### Version 1.4
- Added support for handling empty first rows in input files.
- Improved error handling for missing columns in mapping files.
- Changed TXT file encoding from UTF-8 to UTF-16.
- Added a suggestion to convert Excel files to CSV for faster processing.

### Version 1.5
- Added Cell Reference

### Version 1.5.1
- Fixed duplicate column names in same row

### Version 1.6
- Whitespace is now stripped from all column names before deduplication. This ensures that columns like 'fruit ' and 'fruit' are treated as the same column, and mapping to duplicate columns (e.g., 'fruit', 'fruit_1') works robustly even if there are extra spaces in the Excel file. This fixes mapping and filter issues for columns with trailing or leading spaces.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional file formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
- Enable advanced filtering options with custom logic.
- Provide real-time previews of transformations.
